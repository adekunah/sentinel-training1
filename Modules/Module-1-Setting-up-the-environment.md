### Exercise 2: Configure Azure Sentinel Playbook

In this exercise, we will configure a Playbook that will be later used in the lab. This will allow the playbook to access Sentinel.

1. Navigate to the resource group where the lab has been deployed.

2. In the resource group you should see an API Connection resource called *azuresentinel-Get-GeoFromIpAndTagIncident*, click on it.
