# Module 5 - Hunting
#### ðŸŽ“ Level: 300 (Intermediate)
#### âŒ› Estimated time to complete this lab: 40 minutes

This module will guide you through a proactive hunting procedure. and will review Azure sentinel reach hunting features.

#### Prerequisites
This module assumes that you have completed [Module 1](Module-1-Setting-up-the-environment.md), as the data and the artifacts that we will be using in this module need to be deployed on your Azure Sentinel instance.

### Exercise 1: Acknowledge incident

Based on information we got from our security researchers and following the article they shared regarding activity related to the SolarWinds supply chain Identifying https://medium.com/mitre-attack/identifying-unc2452-related-techniques-9f7b6c7f3714 
Our SOC leads understand that to be able to see the full picture of the attack campaign and to spot anomalies on our data set, we need to run a proactive hunting base on the MITRE tactics and techniques describe in this article.

1.	Review the above article that highlight techniques and the corresponding tools and method.
On this exercise we will focus on T1098. to get more understanding on this technique, review this article https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1098/ 

2.	On the left navigation press on the Hunting 

![incident1](../Images/hunting-1.png)

3. In the hunting blade we can see all the hunting queries that the product ship with.
On the main menu bar we can see the total queries, and results statistics also other advance features like Livestream and Bookmarks.
On the same top menu we can also find the **Run All queries** button and the column selector menu.

![incident2](../Images/hunting-2.png)

From the information we gain from the attack story articles, we understand that we need to focus on specific Techniques.
The Hunting menu blade organize in a MITRE driven view, and we can easily pivot and refine the queries based on tactics and technique.
In our case we know that we need to focus on **T1098**.

4.	On the **Add filter** select **Techniques** and press **Apply**

![incident2](../Images/hunting-3.png)

5.	On the **Techniques** uncheck the **select all* and only select **T1098**

![incident2](../Images/hunting-4.png)

6.	Review all the relevant for this Techniques.
    In this phase we can multi-select all of queries run them as a batch

To do so, press on the multi-select checkbox and  **Run selected queries (Preview)**

**Note**: in some cases, you will need to modify the selected time range based on the time you deploy the lab.

![incident2](../Images/hunting-5.png)

7.	Press on the query and in the right pane press on **View Results** this will navigate us to the log analytics screen with the raw data.

Once we press on the **Run selected queries (Preview)** the results is start popping on the screen, in our case we intimately spot that the **Adding credentials to legitimate OAuth Applications** query return several of results.

8.	On the **Logs** screen we can see all the data that return from this hunting queries with the parsed fields and columns.

From high overview we can see that we have the actor IP and the username that run this operation.
9.	Expend one of the results and check the fields, as you can see, we are able to spot the Azure AD application name, the added key name and type the IP, username of the actor and other relevant information that help us understand the specific action.

10.	Our SOC analyst need to find a way to know which application from all the above result set is critical and has a security Risk.
One way to do it, is to open Azure active directory open each application from the hunting results check their permissions and validate the risk.
Our SOC analyst open the security playbook and based on the organization knowledge base he understands that our SOC maintain a list for all the AAD application with their risk level.

11.	On the **Logs** screen press on the **+** icon to open a new search tab and run the above query 

 ```powershell
_GetWatchlist('ReferenceTemplate')
   ```

   ![incident2](../Images/hunting-8.png)

   As you can see this watchlist store the application name the Risk level and the permissions.
To be able to correlate it with our hunting results set, we need to run a simple join query.

12.	On the same screen edit the query and join it with the hunting data, copy the above query and run it.

 ```powershell
_GetWatchlist('ReferenceTemplate')
| join 
(
AuditLogs_CL
| where OperationName has_any ("Add service principal", "Certificates and secrets management")
| where Result_s =~ "success"
| mv-expand target = todynamic(TargetResources_s)
| where tostring(tostring(parse_json(tostring(parse_json(InitiatedBy_s).user)).userPrincipalName)) has "@" or tostring(parse_json(InitiatedBy_s).displayName) has "@"
| extend targetDisplayName = tostring(parse_json(TargetResources_s)[0].displayName)
| extend targetId = tostring(parse_json(TargetResources_s)[0].id)
| extend targetType = tostring(parse_json(TargetResources_s)[0].type)
| extend eventtemp = todynamic(TargetResources_s)
| extend keyEvents = eventtemp[0].modifiedProperties
| mv-expand keyEvents
| where keyEvents.displayName =~ "KeyDescription"
| extend set1 = parse_json(tostring(keyEvents.newValue))
| extend set2 = parse_json(tostring(keyEvents.oldValue))
| extend diff = set_difference(set1, set2)
| where isnotempty(diff)
| parse diff with * "KeyIdentifier=" keyIdentifier: string ",KeyType=" keyType: string ",KeyUsage=" keyUsage: string ",DisplayName=" keyDisplayName: string "]" *
| where keyUsage == "Verify" or keyUsage == ""
| extend AdditionalDetailsttemp = todynamic(AdditionalDetails_s)
| extend UserAgent = iff(todynamic(AdditionalDetailsttemp[0]).key == "User-Agent", tostring(AdditionalDetailsttemp[0].value), "")
| extend InitiatedByttemp = todynamic(InitiatedBy_s)
| extend InitiatingUserOrApp = iff(isnotempty(InitiatedByttemp.user.userPrincipalName), tostring(InitiatedByttemp.user.userPrincipalName), tostring(InitiatedByttemp.app.displayName))
| extend InitiatingIpAddress = iff(isnotempty(InitiatedByttemp.user.ipAddress), tostring(InitiatedByttemp.user.ipAddress), tostring(InitiatedByttemp.app.ipAddress))
| project-away diff, set1, set2, eventtemp, AdditionalDetailsttemp, InitiatedByttemp
| project-reorder
    TimeGenerated,
    OperationName,
    InitiatingUserOrApp,
    InitiatingIpAddress,
    UserAgent,
    targetDisplayName,
    targetId,
    targetType,
    keyDisplayName,
    keyType,
    keyUsage,
    keyIdentifier,
    CorrelationId
| extend
    timestamp = TimeGenerated,
    AccountCustomEntity = InitiatingUserOrApp,
    IPCustomEntity = InitiatingIpAddress
    ) on $left.AppName == $right.targetDisplayName
| where HighRisk == "Yes"
   ```




4. Read the description of the incident. As you can see, an IOC related to Solorigate attack has been found. In this case, host **ClientPC** is involved.

### Exercise 2: Hunting for more evidence

1. As a next step, you would like to identify any other hosts that might have been compromised as well. As part of your research, you find the following [guidance from Microsoft](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-sentinel/solarwinds-post-compromise-hunting-with-azure-sentinel/ba-p/1995095). In this article, you can find a query that will do a SolarWinds inventory check query. We will use this query to find any other affected hosts.

2. Switch to *Hunting* in the Azure Sentinel menu.

![incident3](../Images/incident3.png)

3. In the search box, type "solorigate". Select *Solorigate Inventory check* query and click on *Run Query*.

![incident4](../Images/incident4.png)

4. You should see a total of three results. Click on *View Results*

![incident5](../Images/incident5.png)

5. As you can see, besides **ClienPC**, there's two additional computers where the malicious DLL and named pipe has been found. Bookmark all three records, selecting them and then click on on *Add bookmark*.

![incident6](../Images/incident6.png)

6. In the window that appears click on *Create* to create the bookmarks. As you can see entity mapping to already done for you.

![incident7](../Images/incident7.png)

7. Wait until the operation finishes and close the log search using the âœ– at the top right corner. This will land you in the Bookmarks tab inside Hunting menu, where you should see your two new bookmarks created. Select both of them and click on *Incident actions* at the top and then *Add to existing incident*.

![incident8](../Images/incident8.png)

8. From the list, pick the Solorigate incident that is assigned to you, and click *Add*.

![incident9](../Images/incident9.png)

9. At this point you can ask the Operations team to isolate the hosts affected by this incident.

### Exercise 3: Add IOC to Threat Intelligence
Now, we will add the IP address related to the incident to our list of IOCs, so we can capture any new occurrences of this IOC in our logs.

1. Go back to *Incidents* view.

2. Select the Solorigate incident and copy the IP address entity involved. Notice that you have now more computer entities available (the ones coming from the bookmarks).

![incident10](../Images/incident10.png)

3. Go to the *Threat Intelligence* menu in Azure Sentinel and click *Add new* at the top.

![incident11](../Images/incident11.png)

4. Enter the following details in the *New indicator* dialog. Then click *Apply*.

![incident12](../Images/incident12.png)

### Exercise 4: Hand over incident
We will now prepare the incident for handover to forensics team.

1. Go to *Incidents* and select the Solorigate incident assigned to you. Click on *View full details*.

2. Move to the *Comments* tab.

![incident13](../Images/incident13.png)

3. Enter information about all the steps performed. As an example:

![incident14](../Images/incident14.png)

4. At this point you would hand over the incident to forensics team.


**Congratulations, you have completed Module 5!**. You can now continue to **[Module 6 - Watchlists](./Module-6-Watchlists.md)**
