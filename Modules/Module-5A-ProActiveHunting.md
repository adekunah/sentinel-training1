# Module 5 - Hunting
#### ðŸŽ“ Level: 300 (Intermediate)
#### âŒ› Estimated time to complete this lab: 40 minutes

This module will guide you through a proactive hunting procedure. and will review Azure sentinel reach hunting features.

#### Prerequisites
This module assumes that you have completed [Module 1](Module-1-Setting-up-the-environment.md), as the data and the artifacts that we will be using in this module need to be deployed on your Azure Sentinel instance.

### Exercise 1: Acknowledge incident

Based on information we got from our security researchers and following the article they shared regarding activity related to the SolarWinds supply chain Identifying https://medium.com/mitre-attack/identifying-unc2452-related-techniques-9f7b6c7f3714 
Our SOC leads understand that to be able to see the full picture of the attack campaign and to spot anomalies on our data set, we need to run a proactive hunting base on the MITRE tactics and techniques describe in this article.

1.	Review the above article that highlight techniques and the corresponding tools and method.
On this exercise we will focus on T1098. to get more understanding on this technique, review this article https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1098/ 

2.	On the left navigation press on the Hunting

3. In the hunting blade we can see all the hunting queries that the product ship with.
On the main menu bar we can see the total queries, and results statistics also other advance features like Livestream and Bookmarks.
On the same top menu we can also find the **Run All queries** button and the column selector menu.

![incident2](../Images/hunting-2.png)

From the information we gain from the attack story articles, we understand that we need to focus on specific Techniques.
The Hunting menu blade organize in a MITRE driven view, and we can easily pivot and refine the queries based on tactics and technique.
In our case we know that we need to focus on **T1098**.

4.	On the **Add filter** select **Techniques** and press **Apply**

4. Read the description of the incident. As you can see, an IOC related to Solorigate attack has been found. In this case, host **ClientPC** is involved.

### Exercise 2: Hunting for more evidence

1. As a next step, you would like to identify any other hosts that might have been compromised as well. As part of your research, you find the following [guidance from Microsoft](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-sentinel/solarwinds-post-compromise-hunting-with-azure-sentinel/ba-p/1995095). In this article, you can find a query that will do a SolarWinds inventory check query. We will use this query to find any other affected hosts.

2. Switch to *Hunting* in the Azure Sentinel menu.

![incident3](../Images/incident3.png)

3. In the search box, type "solorigate". Select *Solorigate Inventory check* query and click on *Run Query*.

![incident4](../Images/incident4.png)

4. You should see a total of three results. Click on *View Results*

![incident5](../Images/incident5.png)

5. As you can see, besides **ClienPC**, there's two additional computers where the malicious DLL and named pipe has been found. Bookmark all three records, selecting them and then click on on *Add bookmark*.

![incident6](../Images/incident6.png)

6. In the window that appears click on *Create* to create the bookmarks. As you can see entity mapping to already done for you.

![incident7](../Images/incident7.png)

7. Wait until the operation finishes and close the log search using the âœ– at the top right corner. This will land you in the Bookmarks tab inside Hunting menu, where you should see your two new bookmarks created. Select both of them and click on *Incident actions* at the top and then *Add to existing incident*.

![incident8](../Images/incident8.png)

8. From the list, pick the Solorigate incident that is assigned to you, and click *Add*.

![incident9](../Images/incident9.png)

9. At this point you can ask the Operations team to isolate the hosts affected by this incident.

### Exercise 3: Add IOC to Threat Intelligence
Now, we will add the IP address related to the incident to our list of IOCs, so we can capture any new occurrences of this IOC in our logs.

1. Go back to *Incidents* view.

2. Select the Solorigate incident and copy the IP address entity involved. Notice that you have now more computer entities available (the ones coming from the bookmarks).

![incident10](../Images/incident10.png)

3. Go to the *Threat Intelligence* menu in Azure Sentinel and click *Add new* at the top.

![incident11](../Images/incident11.png)

4. Enter the following details in the *New indicator* dialog. Then click *Apply*.

![incident12](../Images/incident12.png)

### Exercise 4: Hand over incident
We will now prepare the incident for handover to forensics team.

1. Go to *Incidents* and select the Solorigate incident assigned to you. Click on *View full details*.

2. Move to the *Comments* tab.

![incident13](../Images/incident13.png)

3. Enter information about all the steps performed. As an example:

![incident14](../Images/incident14.png)

4. At this point you would hand over the incident to forensics team.


**Congratulations, you have completed Module 5!**. You can now continue to **[Module 6 - Watchlists](./Module-6-Watchlists.md)**
