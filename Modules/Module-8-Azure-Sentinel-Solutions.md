### Exercise 2: Deploy a new solution

This exercise explains how to install a new solution into your Azure Sentinel workspace.

3. Notice the content being added by this solution (Data Connector, Analytics Rules, Workbook and Hunting Queries). Also notice the disclaimer, saying that the Data Connector is already in the data connectors gallery, so the solution won't deploy this data connector. Click on **Create**.

### Exercise 3: Review and enable deployed artifacts

1. Return to Azure Sentinel home page and navigate to **Analytics Rules**.

2. Type **Dynamics** in the search box. You should see 6 different analytics rules that look at Dynamics 365 data.

3. Notice that these rules are created in **Disabled** state. In a real-world environment, you would need to enable them.

4. Navigate to **Workbooks** under Threat Management. Switch to **My Workbooks** tab and search for Dynamics. You can see the newly deployed workbook. This should be empty unless you have enabled the Dynamics 365 connector.
